# The ragasirtahk Blog
My personal blog. I share things I do here. View it here: https://www.ragasirtahk.tk/

## Technologies Used
- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)

## Theme Used
[Tranquilpeak theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/) for Hugo.

### Theme Credits
*Hugo* version of Tranquilpeak is a based on original [*Hexo* version](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak). This version is simply a port to *Hugo* static site generator. The port was done by [kakawait](https://github.com/kakawait).

Please all the credit should be attributed to [original *Hexo* version](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak) and its author [Louis Barranqueiro](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro).

## Setup for Yourself
I have created a guide explaining how someone can create a blog like mine using Hugo and Netlify CMS. You can view it [here](https://www.ragasirtahk.tk/2018/01/setting-up-netlify-cms-on-hugo/).

## Use as boilerplate
Most of us love boilerplates!

>Feel free to use this repository as a boilerplate for your own blog. 

Credits if used as boilerplate (appreciated but not necessary).

>Credits to this repository and theme creators (see https://github.com/ragasirtahk/The-ragasirtahk-Blog#theme-credits) will be highly appreciated, it takes quite a significant amount of time to make such kind of boilerplate. 

Delete the contents of `/content/post` before using as boilerplate. Also delete the AdSense ad code in `/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/layouts/partials/footer.html` and `/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/layouts/partials/post/header.html
` and delete / change the Google Analytics tracking ID in the `/config.toml` file.

Please also delete `manifest.json`, `OneSignalSDKWorker.js`, `OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js` and the folder `__MACOSX` located in `/static`.

>You can simply fork/clone/download this repository, upload to your server or deploy to **Netlify** and create your own blog. Remember to delete the contents of `/content/post` before uploading or deploying it.

## My love for Netlify
